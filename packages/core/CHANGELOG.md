# @svartz/core

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a4c869f: One sign-in covers every host vault in an app. Every vault's sign-in runs through `callbackVault` (default: the first host vault that enables auth), so each provider needs one callback URL, and the session reads as signed in on every vault. A `callbackVault` that names no vault, a vault without auth, or a vault missing one of the providers fails config loading, naming the vault. Plugins can now read sibling vaults through a `forVault({ vault, vaults })` hook that runs at config resolution. See "Several vaults" in `docs/auth.md`.
- 7a1d5f9: Browser scripts can show HTML as the page shows notes. `context.mountContent(element)` returns a view whose `render(html)` draws the HTML through the page's content components (the host's overrides, then the theme's callout, code block, image, link and embed), sanitized as the build sanitizes, keeping the blocks a render didn't change. `@svartz/plugins/preview` renders a note's Markdown to that HTML in the browser, with GitHub Flavored Markdown, Obsidian's comments, highlights, callouts and tags, and links resolved against the published notes; it imports no Node built-ins, so it also runs in a web worker. `@svartz/plugins/content` exports the content-slot classification the build and the browser renderer share.
- d7303ae: Browser scripts get the note body they serve on a host page. When a host page renders a note with `SvartzNoteContent`, each mount's `context.note` is that note's body, so plugins work on it instead of the document's first `[data-svartz-note]`, and a page with several notes keeps each one's plugin features apart. Theme pages leave it unset.
- d01cd5e: Server plugins reach their Cloudflare bindings under `svartz dev`. A vault on `cloudflare-workers`, `cloudflare-pages`, or a host app on `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare` gets the D1 databases, other bindings, `vars` and `.dev.vars` secrets of the `wrangler.jsonc` (or `.json`, `.toml`) beside `svartz.config.ts` in `context.env`. Local data persists in `.wrangler/state` beside that config, where `wrangler d1 execute --local` reads it. See "Bindings under `svartz dev`" in `docs/server-plugins.md`.
- e46840b: Host SvelteKit apps can run server plugins. Add `svartzHandle` from `virtual:svartz/server` to the app's `hooks.server`, and it routes `<mount>/_svartz/<plugin-id>/` to every host vault's server plugins. A host build with an active server plugin fails when the hooks don't run `svartzHandle`, printing the lines to add, and fails on `@sveltejs/adapter-static`, naming the vault and plugin. See "Server plugins" in `docs/host-vaults.md`.
- 14bc204: A plugin's hooks can hand its server module JSON that only the build knows, such as the notes it published: set it with `getCompilerContributions(ctx).serverData.set(id, data)` and the server factory receives it as its second argument, in the server bundle only. Browser scripts' `mount(pathname, options, context)` now gets `context.base`, the deployment base path, so a script can call its plugin's server at `<base><mount>/_svartz/<id>/`. See `docs/server-plugins.md`.
- 639e96d: A plugin can answer requests at runtime: give it `server: { module, options }` and a standalone vault on `cloudflare-workers`, `cloudflare-pages` or `node` routes `/_svartz/<plugin-id>/` to its handler while pages stay prerendered. A `static` vault with such a plugin fails the build, naming the vault and plugin. Secrets in options are named with `{ env: "NAME" }`. See `docs/server-plugins.md`.

### Patch Changes

- 020d144: Send requests for a page URL that prefer text/markdown, and known AI agents, to the page's emitted Markdown copy with a 303 redirect, so the copy's relative links resolve. Standalone Node and Cloudflare adapters negotiate ahead of static serving through the shared Svartz router, including percent-encoded and slashless page URLs, while static builds retain their Markdown copies and alternate links.
- f55f8fa: Prerender and serve notes with non-ASCII names in standalone builds and generated host routes. Share guarded URL-path decoding with Markdown negotiation and return 404 for malformed escapes.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- bdc5800: `index: { markdown: true }` puts each note's body in its index entry as Markdown with links resolved, for hosts that render notes with their own renderer.

### Minor Changes

- 26588ee: `theme.base` accepts a list of themes to compose in one site: `theme: { base: ['@svartz/theme-api-docs', '@svartz/theme-mcp-docs'] }`. Svartz composes every listed theme's `extensions` with theme-minimal's `composeThemes`; the first listed theme styles the site, and the other `theme` keys apply to all of them. Each relative entry resolves from the config directory. A listed theme that exports no `extensions` fails the build.

  In `@svartz/vite`, `resolveThemeModuleIds` replaces `resolveThemeModuleId`, and `resolveThemeRuntimeImport` replaces `resolveThemeRuntimeImportId`; it returns a `ThemeImport`, the theme modules and composer for a list. `loadThemeModule` takes a map of workspace theme sources, and the CLI passes them in `SVARTZ_THEME_SOURCES` instead of `SVARTZ_THEME_SOURCE_ID` and `SVARTZ_THEME_SOURCE_PATH`.

### Minor Changes

- 67b759b: Every public page now has a Markdown copy for LLM agents at `<page>.md`, linked from the page with `<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown">`, and each vault lists its copies in `llms.txt`. Every theme adds Copy page and View as Markdown buttons to notes. Turn it off with `discovery.llms.enabled: false`.
