Browser scripts can show HTML as the page shows notes. `context.mountContent(element)` returns a view whose `render(html)` draws the HTML through the page's content components (the host's overrides, then the theme's callout, code block, image, link and embed), sanitized as the build sanitizes, keeping the blocks a render didn't change. `@svartz/plugins/preview` renders a note's Markdown to that HTML in the browser, with GitHub Flavored Markdown, Obsidian's comments, highlights, callouts and tags, and links resolved against the published notes; it imports no Node built-ins, so it also runs in a web worker. `@svartz/plugins/content` exports the content-slot classification the build and the browser renderer share.
