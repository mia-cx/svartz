Browser scripts get the note body they serve on a host page. When a host page renders a note with `SvartzNoteContent`, each mount's `context.note` is that note's body, so plugins work on it instead of the document's first `[data-svartz-note]`, and a page with several notes keeps each one's plugin features apart. Theme pages leave it unset.
