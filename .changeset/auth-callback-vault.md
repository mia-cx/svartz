One sign-in covers every host vault in an app. Every vault's sign-in runs through `callbackVault` (default: the first host vault that enables auth), so each provider needs one callback URL, and the session reads as signed in on every vault. A `callbackVault` that names no vault, a vault without auth, or a vault missing one of the providers fails config loading, naming the vault. Plugins can now read sibling vaults through a `forVault({ vault, vaults })` hook that runs at config resolution. See "Several vaults" in `docs/auth.md`.
